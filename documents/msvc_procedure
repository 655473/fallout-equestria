Here are the modifications you need to do on the Panda3D and libRocket libraries to make the project compile fine.

Rocket:
+ Variant.inl
--> Comment the SCRIPTINTERFACE case from the GetInto template.
+ All files
--> Change the name of the Factory class to something unused (we usually change it to RFactory)

Panda3D
+ socket_portable.h
--> Fix the namespace issue in DO_BIND by adding two semicolons before bind
+ time_base.h
--> Add a name to the unnamed enum that defines USEC. We usually name it FUCKYOUMSVC
